Welcome to Math Command, the arithmetic action game.

Installation: Load the program MTHCMD.BA from cassette or disk.

Starting a Game: At the main menu, use the arrow keys to highlight "MTHCMD.BA" then press enter.

The Keyboard: All input is case-insensitive, so the SHIFRT key does not need to be pressed and CAPS LOCK can be on or off. The program also rcognizes both the regular number keys and the numeric keypad, whether the NUM key depressed or not. 

Startup Screen: Choose which type of math facts to practice (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) by pressing the appropriate key, or press the "Q" key to quit. 

Sound: The game may be played with or without sound effects. To turn sound effects on or off, press the space bar in th start up screen. This setting is saved between runs.

Playing the Game: At the beginning of each level, eight cities appear at the bottom of th screen. A math missile will then begin to fall towards one of the cities. To destroy the missile, type correct answer to the math problem.

Entering the Answer: As you type, the answer will appear in the missile base at the bottom of the screen. As soon as the correct answer appears, the math missile will be destroyed. To clear the answer press the space bar. If an incorrect answer is entered, the answer is autonatically clear.

Losing Cities: If a math missile falls all the way to the bottom of the screen without the correct answer being entered, the city will be destroyed. If all cities are destroyed, the game ends.
Ending a Level: A level ends after twenty-five math missiles have dropped. The remaining cities are counted, and th next level begins. The math missiles fall progressively faster in each level

Exiting the game: You may quit th currct game at any time, by pressing the "Q" key.

Scoring: Each time a missile is destroyed, points are awarded based on the difficulty and the level. In addition, bonus points ar awarded for each city remaining at the end of each level.

Author's Notes:

I've seen a number of math facts games over the years, but none of them appealed to me until I saw "Tux of Math Command," an open source game based loosely on "Missile Command."

There were a couple if things I didn't like about "Tux of Math Command," however: it requires a fairly modern processor, and there wasn't an easy way to practice a single type of fact.

Since the game play is relatively simple, I saw no reason that it couldn't implememted on a classic platform, such as the Tandy Model 100 and 102, which has the added advantage of being highly portable.

Match Command is written in 100% BASIC and has ben severely crunched to be as small as possible. Evn though it was optimized for size rather than speed, a delay loop was still required to slow it down enough to be playable.
